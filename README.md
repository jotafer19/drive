## Outcome

- Used **Express** and **PostgreSQL** to build a webpage that resembles a stripped down version of Google Drive. Users should are able to create, read, update and delete folders and upload files in them.
- It allows users to create and delete letters, providing a simple interface for communication.
- The app has a share folder functionality. When a user wants to share a folder (and all of its contents), it generates a link that can be shared with anyone (unauthenticated users).
- Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management, and **Render** to deploy it.
- Tried to maintain **clean code**.

## What I learned

- Deeper understanding of Express and PostgreSQL.
- Dealing with error handling.
- Integration of cloud storage.
